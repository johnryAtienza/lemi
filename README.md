Lemi Frontend Web Developer Test Thank you for your interest in working as a web developer at Lemi!  We would like you to build a single-page webpage to test your knowledge of modern HTML, CSS and Javascript.  You should attempt to make a clone of our current homepage https://app.lemi.travelâ€”only this one page is required.  Note that the current page is generated from a Wordpress-based CMS, so it does not follow best practices for clean and semantic HTML and CSS.  You should follow the design as closely as possible, although we are not expecting pixel perfection. You are welcome to extract existing images from the current site to reproduce the layout.  Upload your completed code as a public Github Repository below. Include a README which explains any choices you made (such as frameworks) and anything we need to do to view the webpage, for example if you have used any CSS preprocessors.  If you have any questions about the task, please let us know.  Once again, thank you for your time and we are looking forward to see the results!
